
Triples contain a subject node, a predicate (UriRef) and an RDF object (Node),  
{{{
Triple( john, height, TypedLiteral( 167, XSD.int ) )
}}}

Assigned objects may be RDF nodes, but also some general Scala objects: Strings, Ints, Booleans...
{{{
john -height-> 167
}}}

Factory method `Graph.build` is used to construct 
{{{
Graph.build( john -height-> 167 )
}}}

You can assign multiple properties to a single subject, with multiple values of the same property:
{{{
john -( isMale -> true, likes -> swimming, likes -> science )
}}}

Assigning multiple values can be shortened using ´ObjSet´:
{{{
john -likes-> ObjSet( swimming, science )
}}}

You can nest other RDF nodes with their own statements, including anonymous (blank) nodes:
{{{
john -(
  name -> Branch( given -> "John", family -> "Doe" ),
  spouse -> ( jane -spouse-> john )
)
}}}

A more deliberate example of graph building can be found at the [Example] page.
