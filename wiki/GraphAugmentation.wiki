Augmentation is construction of additional triples based on existing graph.

Concatenate given name with string and then family name, and add it as a "fullName" property to 
each "name" node:
 
{{{
Augment add {
  n => n -fullName-> ( n/givenName/asString + " " + n/familyName/asString ) 
} forEach { _/-/name }
}}}

For each triple in the graph, if the triple describes height (given as a number of centimeters),
construct one additional triple describing the height in meters (rounded down).

{{{
Augment triples {
  case Triple( s, `height`, TypedLiteral( hInCm, _ ) ) => List( s -metersHigh-> ( hInCm.toInt/100 ) )
}
}}}

Add "age" property calculated as years since birthday for each subject of type "person":

{{{
Augment add {
  p => p -age-> yearsSince( p/birthday/asLocalDate ) 
} forEach {
  _/-/having( RDF.Type -> person ) 
}
}}}
