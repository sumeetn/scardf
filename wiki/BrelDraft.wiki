Identifier declaration is simple:

{{{
on( GET /PT.Element/PT.symbol ) {
  Describe single elementDetails
}
}}}

It says something like:
  On every GET request matching the pattern / _Element_ / _symbol of the element_ describe a single domain concept with these properties, using the `elementDetails` predicate tree.

First we'll need a *domain graph* in which we describe some properties of these concepts.
{{{
pt:Element rdf:Type rdfs:Class ,
           :uriLabel "element" .
pt:symbol  rdf:Type rdf:Property ,
           rdfs:range xsd:string .
}}}

URI path `/element/Si` is tested against the pattern in the declaration. Since the first pattern segment is described in the domain graph as an RDF resource of type `rdfs:Class`, it 

{{{
SELECT ?fc
WHERE {
  ?fc rdf:type pt:Element;
      pt:symbol "Si" .
}
}}}
