#summary API for traversing a RDF graph.

== Traversing a graph ==

Reading a property from a RDF resource is simple:
{{{
N valueOf john
}}}

But a more readable way is with a slash operator, like in XPath. You can even stack the properties to form a path:
{{{
john/N/Given
}}}

But this actually gives you a sequence of RDF node objects, which may be empty, or a single node, or multiple nodes. To convert a node list to a string, you use the same slash operator, but now with a converter:
{{{
john/N/Given/asString == "John"
}}}

Of course, this would only work if the node list contains a single node, a literal convertible to string.

You can use more converters:
{{{
john/BDAY/asLocalDate == new LocalDate( 1977, 7, 27 )
}}}

Another type you can use with a slash operator is a language extractor, useful for multilingual literals:
{{{
john/title/Lang.en
}}}
