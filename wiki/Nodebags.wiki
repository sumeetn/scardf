`GraphNode`s have a *slash operator*. You can connect these operations to form a *path expression*, like in XPath:
{{{
g/john/name/given
}}}

This actually gives you a *bag of RDF nodes in a graph*. This bag may be empty, or it may contain a single node or multiple nodes. To convert a node bag to a string, you use the same slash operator, but now with a *converter object*:
{{{
g/john/name/given/asString == "John"
}}}

There are other converters for other types of literals. They are contained in the `org.scardf.NodeConverter` object.
{{{
g/john/isMale/asBoolean == true
g/john/height/asInt == 167
g/john/birthday/asLocalDate == new LocalDate( 1977, 7, 27 )
}}}

Single-node convertors work only on single-item bags, those that contain exactly one node (in this case a literal convertible to string), and throw exceptions in any other case. But you can construct converters that return options or default values from any single-node converter:
{{{
g/anna/spouse/asNode.option == None
g/anna/weight/asInt.default( 100 ) == 100
}}}

If you expect results of different cardinalities, you can manipulate a slash-operator result as a collection of RDF nodes. 
{{{
( g/anna/spouse ).isEmpty
for ( r <- g/john/likes ) println( r )
}}}

There are also converter modifiers that return collections of specific Scala objects from contained nodes. Adding a `.set` modifier returns a set of nodes instead of a single node:
{{{
g/john/likes/asNode.set == Set( swimming, science )
}}}

*Boolean expressions* in Scardf can have in different forms, to appear as natural as possible. Following expressions all return `true`:
{{{
g/john/isMale?
}}}

If the slash operator returns an empty node list at any point, the whole expression will yield an empty bag - no exception is thrown:
{{{
( anna/Spouse/Name/Family ).isEmpty
}}}

==Filters==

Special type of node bag converter is a *filter*. Place them in a path expression by using the factory object `where`:
{{{
val familyMembers = g.bagOf( john, jane, anna, bob )
familyMembers/where( _/isMale? ) == g.bagOf( john, bob )
familyMembers/where( _/spouse/isMale? )/asNode.set == Set( jane )
familyMembers/where( _/likes contains science ) == g.bagOf( john )
}}}
