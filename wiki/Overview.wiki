Basic use cases of the API are:
 * Defining RDF *vocabularies*
 * *Building* RDF graphs
 * *Traversing* RDF graphs
 * *Querying* RDF graphs

== Defining a vocabulary ==

You can define values in an `object` to define your vocabulary and the basic ontology:
{{{
object PeopleVocabulary extends Vocabulary( "http://person.eg#" ) {
  val Person = pRes( "Person" )
  val Name = pProp( "Name" )
  val Given = pProp( "Given" )
  val Family = pProp( "Family" )
  val Birthday = pProp( "Birthday" ) withRange XSD.date
  val IsMale = pProp( "IsMale" ) withRange XSD.boolean
  val Height = pProp( "Height" ) withRange XSD.int
  val Hobby = pRes( "Hobby" )
  val Likes = pProp( "Likes" ) withRange Hobby
  val Swimming = pRes( "Swimming" ) a Hobby
  val Science = pRes( "Science" ) a Hobby
  val Spouse = pProp( "Spouse" ) withRange Person
}
}}}

== [Building] a graph ==

A graph (model) is constructed as nested expressions
{{{
import PeopleVocabulary._
implicit val model = new Model withPrefix "http://family.eg#"
val jdoe = Res( "jdoe" ) a Person state(
  Name -> Anon(
    Given -> "John",
    Family -> "Doe"
  ),
  Birthday -> "1977-07-27",
  Height -> 167,
  IsMale -> true,
  Likes -> All( Swimming, Science )
)
}}}

== [Traversal Traversing] a graph ==

A graph can be traversed with a slash operator forming an XPath-like expressions:
{{{
jdoe/Name/Given
}}}

These yield a sequence of RDF node objects. To convert a node list to a string, you use the same slash operator, but now with a converter:
{{{
jdoe/Name/Given/asString == "John"
}}}


== [Querying] a graph ==

{{{
val x = new QVar
Sparql selectRes x where( (x, Height, 167) ) from model
}}}

This query expression forms a Sparql query string:
{{{
SELECT ?v1 WHERE { ?v1 <person:Height> 167. }
}}}

This query executed on the example model yields an option `Some( jdoe )`
