Package `org.scardf.jena` allows you to use the power of the Jena library through the DSL programming interface of Scardf.


The package features:

  * `JenaGraph` is the wrapper for Jena Model object that implements the `Graph` trait
  * `Jena` object contains converters between Jena and Scardf node classes

Note: the older `net.croz.scardf` API is a more complete facade to Jena, but it is no longer being developed
